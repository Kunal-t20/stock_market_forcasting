# stock market analysis

This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model to predict stock prices based on historical stock market data. The model is trained on closing prices and visualizes how well it can forecast future stock values.


---

## Features

- Fetches and processes stock market data.
- Prepares time-series datasets for deep learning.
- Implements an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Visualizes training, validation, and predicted results.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – For building the LSTM model.
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** – Data scaling and train-test splitting.
